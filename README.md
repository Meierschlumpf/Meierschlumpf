## About

Hi there üëã
I'm a 21 year old developer from switzerland.
In my freetime, beside coding on personal projects, I like to

- Create fancy meals ü•£
- Play video games with my colleagues üéÆ
- Watch entertainment / technology videos üìπ

## Projects

I contributed or created to the following projects mostly in my freetime.

### ü¶Ä Homarr

[Homarr](https://homarr.dev) is an open source dashboard for self hosted applications. It is self hostable itself and was created with [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc), [drizzleORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm), [GridstackJS](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js) and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/).

### ‚ûï Git Diff IPA

[Git Diff IPA](https://github.com/Meierschlumpf/git-diff-ipa) is a project related to my work as coach in ICT-Academy. It is a tool to create a big table with code changes between two `git diff` commands. It was used by several apprentices to create their code attachement that was required to be in the final assessment document.

### ‚õèÔ∏è Commandmc Server

[Commandmc](https://github.com/commandmc-eu/) is a minecraft minigame server were you can create your own maps and play several minigames. It evolved through multiple states from a command block server, through a datapack server until finally we made it to a plugin server. It is developed by me and other members of the team.

## Technologies

TypeScript is my most loved language so far. I love the deep control over the type safety and always get out of my way to create a fully typesafe application to prevent errors before they happen.

Beside TypeScript I work or worked with the following technologies at work or in personal projects:

- NextJS
- Angular
- C# .NET APIs / MVC
- NodeJS
- Docker
- Terraform
- Jenkins
- Azure Cloud
- Java
- Python
- PHP
